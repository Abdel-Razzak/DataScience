# Final Report Guidelines
The project deliverable is a data product (it could be a website or a mobile app)that contains a final report, 
as well as a well-documented Jupyter notebook. A template for the final report is below. 

Be sure to submit the following:
1. a url with the team report,
2. a well-documented Jupyter notebook, and 
3. a pdf of the Jupyter notebook.

## Final Report should incluude the following:
1. Problem Statement and Motivation: This should be brief and self-contained.
2. Introduction and Description of Data: Description of relevant knowledge. Why is this problem important? Why is it challenging? Introduce the motivations for the project question and how that question was defined through preliminary EDA.
3. Literature Review/Related Work: This could include noting any key papers, texts, or web- sites that you have used to develop your modeling approach, as well as what others have done on this problem in the past. You must properly credit sources.
4. ModelingApproachandProjectTrajectory:Include1)abaselinemodelforcomparisonand 2) a description of your implementations beyond the baseline model. Briefly summarize any changes in your project goals or implementation plans you have made along the way. These changes are a natural part of any project, even those that seem the most straightforward at the beginning. The story you tell about how you arrived at your results can powerfully illustrate your process.
5. Results, Conclusions, and Future Work: Show and interpret your results. Summarize your results, the strengths and short-comings of your results, and speculate on how you might address these short-comings if given more time.
