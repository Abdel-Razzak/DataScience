Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google, said that:
> “The sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians. The ability to take data, to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it, that's going to be a hugely important skill.”

> More and more applications in industry, academia, and everyday life are—or should be—based on careful analysis of data. For example, consider the book Moneyball (for sports) and the work of Nate Silver (for elections as well as sports). More and more data sets are becoming available, to the point where some companies have described themselves as “drowning in data”. This presents many opportunities, but the right tools from both computer science and statistics are needed so that you can learn from the data without drowning.
